# Best Practices

1. **Clear Agent Roles**: Define specific responsibilities for each agent to avoid confusion.
2. **Tool Scoping**: Assign only necessary tools to each agent to reduce hallucination risks.
3. **Supervisor Prompts**: For multi-agent systems, ensure the supervisor's prompt clearly defines the workflow and delegation strategy.
4. **Security**: Use environment variables for API keys and sensitive data.
