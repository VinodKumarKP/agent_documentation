# Features

*   **Unified Agent Interface**: A consistent `BaseAgent` abstraction that standardizes interaction regardless of the underlying agent framework.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Decoupled components for configuration, tool management, document loading, and observability.
*   **Configuration Management**: Flexible YAML-based configuration for agents, models, and tools.
*   **Tool Registry**: Centralized management for registering and loading tools, including support for Model Context Protocol (MCP).
*   **Knowledge Base Integration**: Built-in support for vector stores and document loaders to ground agents in custom data.
*   **Observability**: Integrated tracing and monitoring (e.g., via Langfuse) for debugging and performance analysis.
*   **Extensibility**: Designed to be extended with custom agent implementations, tools, and vector stores.
