# Best Practices

1. **Clear Agent Roles**: Define specific responsibilities for each agent.
2. **Security**: Use environment variables for API keys and credentials.
3. **Tool Assignment**: Only assign necessary tools to each agent to reduce confusion and token usage.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate model (e.g., GPT-4o for complex tasks, GPT-3.5-turbo for simple ones) to balance performance and cost.
