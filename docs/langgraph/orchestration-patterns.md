# Orchestration Patterns

## 1. Single Agent

**When to use:** Simple tasks requiring one specialized agent.

```yaml
agent_list:
  - researcher:
      system_prompt: You are a helpful research assistant.
      tools:
        - web_search
```

## 2. Multi-Agent Supervisor

**When to use:** Complex workflows where a supervisor delegates tasks to specialized workers.

```yaml
system_prompt: You are a supervisor. Delegate tasks to the appropriate worker.

agent_list:
  - researcher:
      system_prompt: You research topics.
  - writer:
      system_prompt: You write summaries based on research.
```

**Flow:**
```
User Input → Supervisor → (Delegates) → Worker Agent → (Returns) → Supervisor → Final Output
```
