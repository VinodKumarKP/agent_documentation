# Deploy your site

Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (SSG).

After every build, the static files are generated in the \`build\` folder.

You can copy the content of the \`build\` folder to any static file hosting service (Apache, Nginx, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel...).

## Build

Run the build command:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

The website is built in the \`build\` directory.

## Deployment

Check the [deployment documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment) to learn how to deploy your site to your favorite provider.
